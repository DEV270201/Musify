I have built a Guitar covers Streaming Application which consists of all the initial covers which I played when I was learning to play guitar in beginning.  
I have added features like :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Dark-Light Theme  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Playing,Looping,Switching,shuffling music  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Adding the music to your favourites

Future Scope:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Improve the UX of the application 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Planning to integrate some kind of analytics 
  
  ### The code is in the master branch of the repository
